## Introduction

This repository hosts the Alpaca Brokerage Plugin Integration with the QuantConnect LEAN Algorithmic Trading Engine. LEAN is a brokerage agnostic operating system for quantitative finance. Thanks to open-source plugins such as this [LEAN](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) can route strategies to almost any market.

[LEAN](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) is maintained primarily by [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com), a US based technology company hosting a cloud algorithmic trading platform. QuantConnect has successfully hosted more than 200,000 live algorithms since 2015, and trades more than $1B volume per month.

[Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) was founded by Yoshi Yokokawa and Hitoshi Harada in 2015 as a database and machine learning company. In 2018, Alpaca Securities LLC (Alpaca Securities) became a registered US broker-dealer with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ([FINRA](https://www.finra.org/)) with the mission to "open financial services to everyone on the planet". In 2022, Alpaca Crypto LLC (Alpaca Crypto) became a registered Money Services Business (MSB) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ([FinCEN](https://www.fincen.gov/)). Alpaca provides access to trading Equities, Options, and Crypto for clients in over 30 countries. Alpaca also delivers custody, clearing, execution, and billing on behalf of registered advisors.

For more information about the Alpaca brokerage, see the [QuantConnect-Alpaca Integration Page](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages/alpaca).

## Using the Brokerage Plugin
  
### Deploying Alpaca with VSCode User Interace

  You can deploy using a visual interface in the QuantConnect cloud. For instructions, see the [QuantConnect-Alpaca Integration Page](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages/alpaca). 
  
  ![deploy-alpaca]() 

  In the QuantConnect Cloud Platform, you can harness the QuantConnect Live Data Feed, the Alpaca Live Data Feed, or both. For most users, this is substantially cheaper and easier than self-hosting.

## Account Types

Alpaca supports cash and margin accounts.

## Order Types and Asset Classes

The following table describes the available order types for each asset class that our Alpaca integration supports.

| Order Type  | Equity | Equity Options | Crypto
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `MarketOrder` | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `LimitOrder` | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `StopMarketOrder` | Yes | Yes | No |
| `StopLimitOrder` | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `TrailingStopOrder` | Yes | Yes | No |


## Downloading Data

For local deployment, the algorithm needs to download the following datasets:

- [US Equities Security Master](https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/quantconnect-us-equity-security-master) provided by QuantConnect
- [US Equities](https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/algoseek-us-equities)
- [US Coarse Universe](https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/quantconnect-us-coarse-universe-constituents)
- [US Equity Options](https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/algoseek-us-equity-options)
- Crypto (e.g. [Coinbase](https://www.quantconnect.com/datasets/coinbase-crypto-price-data))

## Brokerage Model

Lean models the brokerage behavior for backtesting purposes. The margin model is used in live trading to avoid placing orders that will be rejected due to insufficient buying power.

You can set the Brokerage Model with the following statements

    SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Alpaca, AccountType.Cash);
    SetBrokerageModel(BrokerageName.Alpaca, AccountType.Margin);

[Read Documentation](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models/alpaca#01-Introduction)

### Fees

The Alpaca trading for Equity and Equity Options is commission-free. To view the Alpaca trading fees for Crypto, see the [Crypto Fees](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/crypto-fees) page on the Alpaca website. To view how we model their fees, see [Fees](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models/alpaca#06-Fees).

### Margin

We model buying power and margin calls to ensure your algorithm stays within the margin requirements.

[Read Documentation](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages/alpaca#07-Margin)

#### Buying Power

In the US, Alpaca allows up to 2x leverage on Equity trades for margin accounts. In other countries, Alpaca may offer different amounts of leverage. To figure out how much leverage you can access, check with your local legislation or contact an Alpaca representative. We model the US version of Alpaca leverage by default.

#### Margin Calls

Regulation T margin rules apply. When the amount of margin remaining in your portfolio drops below 5% of the total portfolio value, you receive a [warning](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/margin-calls#08-Monitor-Margin-Call-Events). When the amount of margin remaining in your portfolio drops to zero or goes negative, the portfolio sorts the generated margin call orders by their unrealized profit and executes each order synchronously until your portfolio is within the margin requirements.

#### Pattern Day Trading

If all of the following statements are true, you are classified as a pattern day trader:

- You reside in the United States.
- You trade in a margin account.
- You execute 4+ intraday US Equity trades within 5 business days.
- Your intraday US Equity trades represent more than 6% of your total trades.

Pattern day traders must maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 in their margin account to continue trading. For more information about pattern day trading, see [Am I a Pattern Day Trader?](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/day-trading-margin-requirements-know-rules) on the FINRA website.

The `PatternDayTradingMarginModel` doesn't enforce minimum equity rules and doesn't limit your trades, but it adjusts your available leverage based on the market state. During regular market hours, you can use up to 4x leverage. During extended market hours, you can use up to 2x leverage.

```
security.MarginModel = new PatternDayTradingMarginModel();
```

### Slippage

Orders through Alpaca do not experience slippage in backtests. In paper trading and live trading, your orders may experience slippage.

### Fills

We fill market orders immediately and completely in backtests. In live trading, if the quantity of your market orders exceeds the quantity available at the top of the order book, your orders are filled according to what is available in the order book.

### Settlements

If you trade with a margin account, trades settle immediately. If you trade with a cash account, Equity trades settle 2 days after the transaction date (T+2) and Option trades settle on the business day following the transaction (T+1).


### Deposits and Withdraws

You can deposit and withdraw cash from your brokerage account while you run an algorithm that's connected to the account. We sync the algorithm's cash holdings with the cash holdings in your brokerage account every day at 7:45 AM Eastern Time (ET).

LEAN Engine is an open-source algorithmic trading engine built for easy strategy research, backtesting, and live trading. We integrate with common data providers and brokerages, so you can quickly deploy algorithmic trading strategies.

The core of the LEAN Engine is written in C#, but it operates seamlessly on Linux, Mac and Windows operating systems. To use it, you can write algorithms in Python 3.8 or C#. QuantConnect maintains the LEAN project and uses it to drive the web-based algorithmic trading platform on the website.
